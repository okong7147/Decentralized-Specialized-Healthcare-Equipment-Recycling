# Decentralized Specialized Healthcare Equipment Recycling

A blockchain-based system for tracking and managing the lifecycle of recycled medical equipment from registration through distribution to underserved healthcare facilities.

## Core Components

This project consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Device Registration Contract**: Records and tracks used medical equipment entering the recycling ecosystem
2. **Refurbishment Verification Contract**: Documents the restoration process and ensures devices are returned to working condition
3. **Certification Contract**: Validates that refurbished equipment meets necessary safety and functionality standards
4. **Allocation Contract**: Manages the fair and efficient distribution of certified equipment to facilities in need

## Purpose

This platform aims to increase access to specialized healthcare equipment in underserved regions by creating a transparent, traceable system for recycling and repurposing medical devices. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that all stakeholders can verify the provenance, quality, and allocation of equipment.

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Complete visibility into the device lifecycle
- **Trust**: Immutable verification of refurbishment and certification
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined allocation of resources where they're most needed
- **Sustainability**: Extended lifecycle of specialized medical equipment
- **Accountability**: Clear records of responsibility at each stage
